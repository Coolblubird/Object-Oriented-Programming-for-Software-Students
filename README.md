#### Intermediate to Programming

This repo hold an example of the work I can do. I am making for my local trade school (South West Tech).

I am a huge nerd. I love to program games and design them, I like to watch the project unfold by my own hands.

I want to learn the ins and outs of programming, which is why I am taking this course.
